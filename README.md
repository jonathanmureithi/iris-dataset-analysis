## 🧠 What is the Iris Dataset?

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (*setosa*, *versicolor*, *virginica*) with the following features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## 🔍 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- Loaded the dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
- Converted it to a pandas DataFrame
- Inspected the data structure and checked for missing values

### ✅ Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Computed statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation
- Grouped data by species to observe trends
- Noted that *virginica* generally has the longest petals

### ✅ Task 3: Data Visualization
- 📈 **Line chart** showing average petal length per species
- 📊 **Bar chart** of average sepal width by species
- 📉 **Histogram** of petal length distribution
- 🔘 **Scatter plot** showing relationship between sepal length and petal length

## 📊 Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📎 How to Run the Notebook

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
2. Launch `iris_dataset_analysis_jonathan.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook cells in order (Shift + Enter)

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The Iris dataset provides a simple but powerful example of how statistical analysis and visualization can help us understand data patterns. In this project, we discovered that petal measurements are particularly useful in distinguishing between species.
